Why use CFD The CFD Process The CFD process is rarely completely linear. Often, we prepare geometry, generate our mesh, set up the model, and solve, and then go back to the meshing or pre-processing stage. This can be because the model simply didn't converge, or because we notice something unusual in some initial results, or because we wish to complete a mesh or time-step dependency study. But, after a few loops, we can go on to the final post-processing where we produce images and videos and make judgments on the results. mermaid flowchart TD subgraph 1[Pre-processing] A[Geometry Preparation] --> B[Mesh Generation] B --> C[Physics Selection] C --> D[Boundary Condition Specification] end subgraph 2[Solving] E[Initialisation] --> F[Monitoring] end subgraph 3[Post-processing] G[X-Y Plots] H[Vector Plots] I[Contour Plots] J[Animations] end K[Analysis] --> L[Report] 1 --> 2 2 --> 3 3 --> K K --> 1 Pre-processing Geometry preparation Meshing Physics selection Boundary condition specification Solving Initialisation Monitoring Post-processing XY plots Vector plots Contour plots Animations Governing equations The Continuity equation Continuity equation derivation The momentum equation Momentum equation derivation The energy equation Energy equation derivation Numerical methods Finite difference method Finite volume method Finite element method Mesh generation Types of mesh Mesh specification Near-wall sizing The computations of flow near to any walls needs specific treatment for the model to solve. The flow nearest to the wall moves has a near-zero velocity due to friction between the fluid particles and the wall itself. The velocity increases further from the wall until it reaches the free stream velocity. The layer closest to the wall, where the velocity is below the free stream velocity is referred to as the boundary layer. The boundary layer itself splits into three other layers: the viscous sublayer, the buffer layer, and the outer layer. The viscous sublayer is the laminar layer nearest to the wall and dominated by the viscous shear stresses between the particles themselves, and their interaction with the wall. The outer layer is a turbulence dominated layer within the boundary layer, and is furthest from the wall. The buffer layer, between the viscous sublayer and turbulent layer, is a blending of the two. To assess the flow near to the wall several dimensionless terms are used. The most important of these is \\(y_{+}\\) . The \\(y_{+}\\) is a dimensionless distance from the wall which could be interpreted as being a local Reynolds Number, in that it determines the relative importance of viscous and turbulent flows. \\[ y_{+} = \\dfrac{y u_{\\tau}}{\\nu}\\] The \\(y_{+}\\) is a function of the absolute wall distance, \\(y\\) , the fluid's kinematic viscosity, \\(\\nu\\) , and the friction velocity, \\(u_{\\tau}\\) . The friction velocity is a form of shear stress, written in terms of the flow velocity. \\[ u_{\\tau} = \\sqrt{\\dfrac{\\tau_{w}}{\\rho}} \\] The friction velocity is a function of the fluid's density, \\(\\rho\\) , and the wall shear stress, \\(\\tau_{w}\\) . The wall shear stress is determined by: \\[ \\tau_{w} = \\rho \\nu \\dfrac{du}{dy}\\] Wall chear stress is dependent on the fluid properties, specifically kinematic viscosity and density, and the the change in velocity at a given change in distance from the wall, \\(\\dfrac{du}{dy}\\) . An additional dimensionless quantity, dimensionless velocity, \\(u_{+}\\) , can be obtained from the above, and the fluid velocity, \\(u\\) . \\[ u_{+} = \\dfrac{u}{u_{\\tau}}\\] By comparing the \\(u_{+}\\) and \\(y_{+}\\) values within the boundary layer, fu Within the viscous sublayer the shear stress is approximately constant and equivalent to the wall shear stress. This means that the dimensionless values \\(u_{+}\\) and \\(y_{+}\\) can be considered equal to one another (Reference 1, Equation 7.8). This is true when \\(u_{+}\\) and \\(y_{+}\\) , constituting the viscous sublayer. \\[u_{+} = y_{+}\\] However, when turbulent effects become more dominant, such as in the outer layer, a logarithmic equation is used to account for the relationship between \\(u_{+}\\) and \\(y_{+}\\) (Reference 1, Equation 7.9).

container They have widely spaced molecules with weak cohesive forces Molecular movement is very high Properties are easily affected by changes in temperature and pressure Easily compressible due to high molecule spacing They have no free surface and are not dominated by gravity, except in buoyancy Liquids Liquids take the shape of their container, but not its volume They have closely packed molecules with strong cohesive forces Molecules are relatively free to move They create a free surface and are dominated by gravity Properties vary only slightly with changes in temperature and pressure Not easily compressed; often considered incompressible Solids Solids are able to resist shear stress by static deflection The spacing between molecules is generally very low The individual molecular movement is very low They are made up of structured and rigidly attached molecules Fluid continuum Fluid is treated as a continuum for calculation purposes, instead of modelling individual behavior of molecules, and average conditions assumed This is accurate, except when the number of molecules is low and the spacing between them is great (i.e. gasses at very low pressures) Dimensions and units There are four primary dimensions in fluid mechanics: Mass (kg) Length (m) Time (s) Temperature (K) All other dimensions used in fluid mechanics can be derived from these All equations must be dimensionally homogeneous - each additive must have the same dimension All equations must have consistent units - each additive must have the same units Fluid properties The following properties help to define all fluids: Density Density, \\(\\rho\\) , is ratio of the amount of mass, \\(m\\) , a substance has to its volume, \\(V\\) , measured in \\(\\frac{kg}{m^3}\\) \\[ \\rho = \\dfrac{m}{V} \\] Pressure A ratio of the pressure that a fluid exerts on a given surface to the area of that surface, measured in \\(\\frac{N}{m^2} = Pa = 10^{-5} bar\\) \\[ p = \\dfrac{F}{A} \\] All fluids have pressure Gauge pressure is set such that at sea level, a gauge will read zero Absolute pressure, on the other hand, includes the pressure of the atmosphere, such that at sea level, absolute pressure is approximately 101325Pa Static pressure Static pressure is the pressure that a fluid is at when nothing is moving and it is at rest, generated by the depth, \\(h\\) , of the fluid and gravity, \\(g\\) \\[ p_s=\\rho gh \\] Dynamic pressure Dynamic pressure is pressure within a fluid which is generated by the velocity, \\(u\\) , of either the fluid or a surface \\[ p_d = \\dfrac{1}{2}\\rho v^2 \\] Total pressure Total pressure is the sum of those pressures \\[ p_t=p_s+p_d \\] Temperature Temperature, \\(T\\) , relates to the average kinetic energy of atoms and molecules in a system, measured in \\({}^\\circ C=273.15K\\) At absolute 0, there is no molecular motion and so this is the lowest possible temperature Viscosity A fluid property responsible for a fluid's resistance to shear stresses There are two types of viscosity Dynamic Derived from a proportionality constant of shear stress, \\(\\tau\\) , with velocity gradient, \\(\\frac{du}{dy}\\) , measured in \\(Pa s =

spherical due to surface tension Forces between molecules of a liquid are bound to each other, and so they are cohesive, this is why liquids tend to remain as one body, rather than filling their volume as gasses do Forces between the molecules of a liquid and its solid boundary give rise to adhesion, and so the liquid will spread across the surface, increasing the contact area Compressible fluids In addition to those listed above, the following properties are additionally considered for calculations where a fluid is thought to be compressible Bulk modulus The bulk modulus, \\(B\\) , is used to define how much a system compresses, measured in \\(Pa\\) It relates a change in pressure, \\(dp\\) , to the change in volume, \\(dV\\) \\[ B = -V\\dfrac{dp}{dV} \\] Compressibility Compressibility, \\(K\\) , is the inverse of bulk modulus, measured in \\(\\frac{1}{Pa}\\) \\[ K = \\dfrac{1}{B} \\] Mach number The Mach number, \\(M\\) , of a fluid is a ratio of the fluid speed, \\(u\\) , to the speed of sound, \\(a\\) , in that fluid \\[ M = \\dfrac{u}{a} \\] When the Mach number is above 0.3, a fluid is generally considered compressible Typically, liquids are modelled as

RT \\] Flow classification The following classifications exist to enable selection of appropriate calculations Internal and external flows Internal flows are flows between bounding surfaces, such as in pipework External flows are flows where a body is surrounded by a fluid, such as flow over an aircraft wing Laminar and turbulent flows Laminar flow tends to flow in straight lines, with no mixing Turbulent flow, on the other hand, fluctuates in direction, causing mixing within the fluid Steady and unsteady flows Steady flows are those which are not considered to change over time; the fluid properties at a set point remain constant Unsteady flows, on the other hand, is time dependent, otherwise known as transient, and the fluid properties at a given location will change over time Compressible and incompressible flows Compressible flows are those where the compressibility of the fluid is significant, typically when the Mach number is above 0.3 Incompressible flows are unrealistic, but can be assumed when the Mach number is low Frames of reference There are two typical frames of reference for fluid mechanics: Lagrangian focusses on pressure changes that a single particle experiences through space and time Eularian focusses on calculating the whole pressure fields of the flow pattern Eularian is generally most suited to fluid mechanics calculations

& \\dots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Addition and multiplication Matrices of the same size can be added element by element: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} + \\begin{bmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a+e & b+f \\\\ c+g & d+h \\end{bmatrix} \\] Matrices which are not the same size cannot be added Multiplying a matrix by a scalar is also element by element: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\times e = \\begin{bmatrix} ae & be \\\\ ce & de \\end{bmatrix} \\] The matrix can be any size when multiplying by a scalar Multiplying two matrices requires multiplying across the rows of the first matrix, and down the columns of the second and summing the result: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} ae+bg & af+bh \\\\ ce+dg & cf+dh \\end{bmatrix} \\] The order of the matrices in the multiplication is important (they do not commute): \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} e & f \\\\ g & h \\end{bmatrix} \\times \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} ea+fc & eb+fd \\\\ ga+hc & gb+hd \\end{bmatrix} \\] Because the rows of the first matrix are multiplied by the columns of the second, the first matrix must have the same number of rows as the second's number of columns The general formula for the multiplication of matrices is: \\[ C = A B \\] \\[ \\ c_{ij} = \\sum_{k=1}^{n} 2^{-n} = a_{ik} b_{kj} \\] Special matrices The zero matrix is one where all elements are equal to zero: \\[ 0 = \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] The identity matrix is a matrix where diagonal elements are equal to 1, and all other elements are 0: \\[ I = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] The identity matrix does commute: \\[ AI = IA \\] Diagonal matrices have non-zero elements only on the diagonal: \\[ D = \\begin{bmatrix} d_{11} & 0 \\\\ 0 & d_{22} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Banded matrices have non-zero elements on the bands parallel to the diagonal For example, a tridiagonal banded matrix has three bands: \\[ B = \\begin{bmatrix} b_{11} & b_{12} & 0 \\\\ b_{21} & b_{22} & b_{23} \\\\ 0 & b_{32} & b_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Triangular matrices have elements either above or below the diagonal An upper diagonal matrix: \\[ U = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{11} & u_{12} & u_{13} \\\\ 0 & u_{22} & u_{23} \\\\ 0 & 0 & u_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\] A lower diagonal matrix: \\[ L = \\begin{bmatrix} l_{11} & 0 & 0 \\\\ l_{21} & l_{22} & 0 \\\\ l_{31} & l_{32} & l_{33} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Transpose matrices A transpose of a matrix is its mirror along the diagonal When transposed, a matrix's rows become its columns and its columns its rows \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{12} & \\dots & a_{1n} \\\\ a_{21} & a_{22} & \\dots & a_{2n} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{m1} & a_{m2} & \\dots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ A^{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} a_{11} & a_{21} & \\dots & a_{m1} \\\\ a_{12} & a_{22} & \\dots & a_{m2} \\\\ \\vdots & \\vdots & \\ddots & \\vdots \\\\ a_{n1} & a_{2n} & \\dots & a_{mn} \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ A_{ij} = A_{ji} \\] When transposing an MxN matrix, it becomes NxM Transposing a transpose returns the original matrix \\[ (A^{T})^{T} = A \\] Adding two matrices and transposing is equal to the sum of the transposes \\[ (A+B)^{T} = A^{T} + B^{T} \\] Multiplying two matrices and transposing is equal to the reverse of the product of the transposes \\[ (AB)^{T} = B^{T} A^{T} \\] If a matrix's transpose is equal to the matrix, it is said to be symmetric \\[ A = A^{T} \\] If a matrix's transpose is equal to the negative of the matrix, it is said to be skew-symmetric \\[ -A = A^{T} \\] Inner and outer products The inner product is the same as the dot product \\[ U = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{1} \\\\ u_{2} \\\\ u_{3} \\end{bmatrix}, V = \\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\end{bmatrix} \\] To calculate the inner product, one matrix must be transposed \\[ U^{T} V = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{1} & u_{2} & u_{3} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} \\\\ v_{2} \\\\ v_{3} \\end{bmatrix} = u_{1}v_{1} + u_{2}v_{2} + u_{3}v_{3} \\] If the inner product is equal to 0, then U and V are orthogonal The norm of a vector is it's length \\[ \\|U\\| = \\sqrt{U^{T} U} = \\sqrt{u_{1}^2+u_{2}^2+u_{3}^2} \\] A vector has been normalised when the norm is equal to 1 If two vectors are both orthogonal and normalised, they are orthonormal The outer product is the inverse of the inner product \\[ U V^{T} = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{1} \\\\ u_{2} \\\\ u_{3} \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} v_{1} & v_{2} & v_{3} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} u_{1}v_{1} & u_{1}v_{2} & u_{1}v_{3}\\\\ u_{2}v_{1} & u_{2}v_{2} & u_{2}v_{3}\\\\ u_{3}v_{1} & u_{3}v_{2} & u_{3}v_{3} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Inverse matrices Not all matrices can be inverted A matrix is only invertible when the matrix is square and: \\[ A A^{-1} = I = A^{-1} A \\] Multiplying two matrices and inverting them is equal to the reverse of the product of the inverses \\[ (AB)^{-1} = B^{-1} A^{-1} \\] The inverse of a transpose is equal to the transpose of an inverse: \\[ (A^{T})^{-1} = (A^{-1})^{T} \\] Some equations are derived which can be used to calculate the inverse \\[ A A^{-1} = I \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_{1} & x_{2} \\\\ y_{1} & y_{2} \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] We can make the following set of equations: \\[ \\begin{align*} a x_{1} + b y_{1} &= 1 \\\\ a x_{2} + b y_{2} &= 0 \\\\ c x_{1} + d y_{1} &= 0 \\\\ c x_{2} + d y_{2} &= 1 \\end{align*} \\] Therefore: \\[ \\begin{align*} y_{1} &= \\dfrac{-c}{d} x_{1} \\\\ y_{2} &= \\dfrac{-a}{b} x_{2} \\end{align*} \\] Finding x1: \\[ \\begin{align*} a x_{1} + b y_{1} &= 1 \\\\ a x_{1} + b \\dfrac{-c}{d} x_{1} &= 1 \\\\ x_{1}\\left(\\dfrac{ad}{d} - \\dfrac{bc}{d}\\right)&= 1 \\\\ x_{1} &= \\dfrac{d}{ad-bc} \\end{align*} \\] Finding y1: \\[ \\begin{align*} y_{1} &= \\dfrac{-c}{d} x_{1} \\\\ y_{1} &= \\dfrac{-c}{d} \\dfrac{d}{ad-bc} \\\\ y_{1} &= \\dfrac{-c}{ad-bc} \\end{align*} \\] Finding x2: \\[ \\begin{align*} c x_{2} + d y_{2} &= 1 \\\\ c x_{2} + d \\dfrac{-a}{b} x_{2} &= 1 \\\\ x_{2}\\left(\\dfrac{cb}{b} - \\dfrac{ad}{b}\\right) &= 1 \\\\ x_{2} &= \\dfrac{b}{cb-ad} \\\\ x_{2} &= \\dfrac{-b}{ad-bc} \\end{align*} \\] Finding y2: \\[ \\begin{align*} y_{2} &= \\dfrac{-a}{b} x_{2} \\\\ y_{2} &= \\dfrac{-a}{b} \\dfrac{-b}{ad-bc} \\\\ y_{2} &= \\dfrac{a}{ad-bc} \\end{align*} \\] Therefore: \\[ A^{-1} = \\dfrac{1}{ad-bc} \\begin{bmatrix} d & -b \\\\ -c & a \\end{bmatrix} \\] And so, the determinant of the 2x2 matrix is: \\[ |A| = ad-bc \\] If the determinant is equal to 0, then the matrix is not invertible Orthogonal matrices The inverse of an orthogonal matrix is equal to the transpose of the matrix \\[ Q^{-1} = Q^{T} \\] Therefore: \\[ \\begin{align*} Q Q^{T} &= I \\\\ Q^{T} Q &= I \\end{align*} \\] Both the rows and columns of an orthogonal matrix are orthogonal Orthogonal matrices preserve norms; for a matrix Q and column vector x the norm is: \\[ (Q x)^{T} (Q x) = \\| Qx \\|^{2} \\] We can write the first expression as: \\[ x^{T} Q^{T} Q x \\] As \\(Q^{T} Q = I\\) , we can simplify to: \\[ x^{T} x \\] Which becomes: \\[ \\| x \\|^{2} \\] Therefore, we can prove that the orthogonal matrix Q preserves norms (lengths) because: \\[ \\| x \\|^{2} = \\| Qx \\|^{2} \\] Permutation matrices Permutation matrices are a type of orthogonal matrix When an NxN permutation matrix is multiplied by another matrix, the rows of the matrix are permuted (rearranged) For a 2x2 matrix, there are 2 possible permutations The first permutation is that there is no change, this happens when the permutation matrix is the identity matrix: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} \\] For the second permutation: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} a & b \\\\ c & d \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} c & d \\\\ a & b \\end{bmatrix} \\] For a 3x3 matrix, the number of possible permutations is \\(3! = 6\\) Permutation matrices may be obtained by permuting the rows of the identity matrix: \\[ P A = (P I) A \\] Systems of Linear Equations Gaussian elimination Gaussian elimination is used to solve systems of linear equations Gaussian elimination relies on performing operations on a matrix made up of a system of linear equations which modify the matrix without changing the solution This includes: Permuting the rows Multiplying rows by a constant Summing rows which have been multiplied by a constant These operations are performed on the matrix until an upper triangular matrix is formed An example is used below to demonstrate the process \\[ \\begin{align*} -3x_1+2x_2-x_3&=-1\\\\ 6x_1-6x_2+7x_3&=-7\\\\ 3x_1-4x_2+4x_3&=-6 \\end{align*} \\] First, the system of equations are written as a matrix multiplication \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} -1 \\\\ -7 \\\\ -6 \\end{bmatrix} \\] From this, the augmented matrix can be formed \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & -1\\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 & -7\\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 & -6 \\end{bmatrix} \\] A pivot (red) is selected, and the rows below the pivot undergo operations to make any values directly below the pivot equal to zero \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red}{-3} & 2 & -1 & -1\\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 & -7\\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 & -6 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} \\\\ + 2 \\times Row 1\\\\ + 1 \\times Row 1 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & -1\\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 & -9\\\\ 0 & -2 & 3 & -7 \\end{bmatrix} \\] A new pivot is then selected, and the same procedure is repeated \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & -1\\\\ 0 & \\color{red}{-2} & 5 & -9\\\\ 0 & -2 & 3 & -7 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} \\\\ \\\\ + -1 \\times Row 2 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & -1\\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 & -9\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 & 2 \\end{bmatrix} \\] This matrix can now be converted back into a system of equations to be solved by back substitution \\[ \\begin{align*} -3x_1+2x_2-x_3&=-1\\\\ -2x_2+5x_3&=-9\\\\ -2x_3&=2\\\\ x_3 &= -1 \\end{align*} \\] \\[ \\begin{align*} -2 x_2 - 5&=-9\\\\ -2x_2&=-4\\\\ x_2&=2 \\end{align*} \\] \\[ \\begin{align*} -3x_1+4+1&=-1\\\\ -2x_1&=-6\\\\ x_1&=2 \\end{align*} \\] Reduced row echelon form The reduced row echelon form is an expansion on Gaussian elimination In this form, the diagonal elements of the matrix should all become one, and the values above and below them equal to zero \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\\\ 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red}{1} & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 4 & 5 & 6 & 7\\\\ 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} \\\\ + -4 \\times Row 1\\\\ + -6 \\times Row 1 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 0 & -3 & -6 & -9\\\\ 0 & -5 & -10 & -15 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 0 & -3 & -6 & -9\\\\ 0 & -5 & -10 & -15 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} \\\\ \\div -3\\\\ \\div -5 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 2 & 3 & 4\\\\ 0 & \\color{red}{1} & 2 & 3\\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} + -2 \\times Row 2 \\\\ \\\\ + -1 \\times Row 2 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2\\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ RREF(A) = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & -1 & -2\\\\ 0 & 1 & 2 & 3\\\\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Computing inverses The reduced row echelon form can be used to find inverses of matrices \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] For a matrix to be invertible: \\[ \\begin{align*} A A^{-1} &= I \\\\ A a_{i}^{-1} &= e_i \\end{align*} \\] We combine the identity matrix and the original matrix for the augmented matrix: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] And calculate the reduced row echelon form: \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red}{-3} & 2 & -1 & 1 & 0 & 0\\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 & 0 & 1 & 0\\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} {}\\\\ {}+ 2 \\times Row 1\\\\ {}+ 1 \\times Row 1 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 & 2& 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -2 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & 0\\\\ 0 & \\color{red}{-2} & 5 & 2& 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -2 & 3 & 1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} {}+ 1 \\times Row 2\\\\ {}\\\\ {}+ -1 \\times Row 2 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 & 2& 1 & 0\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 0 & 4 & 3 & 1 &

-3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2\\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{5}{2}\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 0 & 0 & 1 & -1 & 2\\\\ 0 & -2 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{3}{2} & \\frac{5}{2}\\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 & -1 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} \\div -3\\\\ \\div -2\\\\ \\div -2 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 &

inverse is: \\[ A= \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 & -\\frac{1}{3} & \\frac{1}{3} & -\\frac{2}{3}\\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 & \\frac{1}{4} & \\frac{3}{4} & -\\frac{5}{4}\\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & -\\frac{1}{2} \\end{bmatrix} \\] Elementary matrices and LU decomposition Gaussian elimination returns a matrix \\(A\\) as an upper triangular matrix This cal also be expressed as an upper triangular matrix \\(U\\) multiplied by a lower triangular matrix \\(L\\) This is referred to as a matrix decomposition \\[ A = \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red}{-3} & 2 & -1 \\\\ 6 & -6 & 7 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} {} \\\\ {} + 2 \\times Row 1\\\\ {} \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} = M_1 A \\] As we added \\(2\\times\\) the first row to the second, the first elementary matrix is: \\[ M_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\begin{bmatrix} \\color{red}{-3} & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 \\\\ 3 & -4 & 4 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{matrix} {} \\\\ {} \\\\ {} + 1 \\times Row 1 \\end{matrix} \\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 3 \\end{bmatrix} = M_2 M_1 A \\] And so the second elementary matrix becomes: \\[ M_2 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 &

\\Rightarrow \\begin{bmatrix} -3 & 2 & -1 \\\\ 0 & -2 & 5 \\\\ 0 & 0 & -2 \\end{bmatrix} = M_3 M_2 M_1 A = U \\] And the third elementary matrix: \\[ M_3 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & -1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] Where: \\[ M_3 M_2 M_1 A = U \\] \\[ \\therefore A = M_1^{-1} M_2^{-1} M_3^{-1} U \\] The inverses of the elementary matrices are found: \\[ M_1 = \\begin{bmatrix} 1

\\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ M_1^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} M_2^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} M_3^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] The elementary matrices are then multiplied: \\[ M_1^{-1} M_2^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ (M_1^{-1} M_2^{-1}) M_3^{-1} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 0 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\\\ 0 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] And a lower triangular matrix is produced: \\[ L = \\begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\\\ -2 & 1 & 0 \\\\ -1 & 1 & 1 \\end{bmatrix} \\] \\[ \\therefore A = L U \\] Vector
